## Summary
Hi, I'm a **Mobile Engineer** with over 5 years of experience specializing in native Android development. I've worked on a range of production-level applications, contributing to large-scale teams with 30+ developers. My primary focus has been on Android, using Java and Kotlin to build seamless, high-performance apps, but I’m always eager to expand my skill set. I’m excited about the potential of learning new technologies like iOS development, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and Flutter, as I believe they can enhance my versatility and allow me to contribute even more effectively to cross-platform projects.

I'm passionate about solving complex problems and delivering high-quality mobile experiences. Whether working on large teams or independently, I take pride in my ability to stay adaptable, collaborate effectively, and maintain a high standard of code quality. I'm constantly driven to learn and improve, and I'm excited to take on new challenges in mobile development.
